      <h2>Clips</h2>

      <p>Here are various mp3 clips of my playing. I am often asked if I have CDs for sale. Regrettably, I have only, thus far, recorded miscellaneous tracks.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="/mp3/laccordeoniste.mp3" title="L'accord&eacute;oniste mp3 recording played by Hugh Barwell">L'accord&eacute;oniste</a> - A favourite Edith Piaf song.</li>
        <li><a href="/mp3/le-plus-beau-tango-du-monde.mp3" title="Le Plus Beau Tango du Monde mp3 recording played by Hugh Barwell">Le Plus Beau Tango du Monde</a> - Well known French tango, played on my Roland accordion.</li>
        <li><a href="/mp3/sunny-afternoon.mp3" title="Sunny Afternoon mp3 recording played by Hugh Barwell">Sunny Afternoon</a> - A studio recording using synth modules and so on. &lsquo;The taxman's taken all my dough&hellip;&rsquo;</li>
        <li><a href="/mp3/dixon.mp3" title="Dixon (of Dock Green) signature tune mp3 recording played by Hugh Barwell">Dixon (of Dock Green) signature tune</a> - A nostalgic old English favourite. The first half is just my Roland accordion, live. In the second half, I have played guitar chords as well.</li>
        <li><a href="/mp3/carte-postale.mp3" title="Carte Postale mp3 recording played by Hugh Barwell">Carte Postale</a> - Part of a lovely French valse as played by Danielle Pauly, specially composed for her excellent album Fleur du Jura.</li>
        <li><a href="/mp3/letoile-des-troubadours.mp3" title="L'&eacute;toile des Troubadours mp3 recording played by Hugh Barwell">L'&eacute;toile des Troubadours</a> - Not being a real singer, I normally only sing to lead a singalong. It's not easy to play and sing well simultaneously! But with the luxury of multitracking, I had a go at this traditional French song, doing the vocal and the various accordion parts.</li>
        <li><a href="/mp3/godfather-love-theme.mp3" title="Godfather Love Theme mp3 recording played by Hugh Barwell">Godfather Love Theme</a> - From the original Godfather film 1972. Music by Nino Rota.</li>

I play this on my Roland FR1x accordion.</li>
        <li><a href="/mp3/Allo_Allo.mp3" title="'Allo 'Allo mp3 recording played by Hugh Barwell">'Allo 'Allo</a> - The famous TV theme, with an extra section (in the minor) that I made up.</li>
        <li><a href="/mp3/Pilgrims_Progress.mp3" title="Pilgrim's Progress mp3 recording played by Hugh Barwell">Pilgrim's Progress (1969)</a> - Experimenting with the organ sounds on my Roland FR1x accordion: this is from Procol Harum's third album.
