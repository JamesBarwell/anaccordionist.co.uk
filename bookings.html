      <h2>Bookings</h2>
      <h3>It need not cost the earth to hire a professional musician for your function, to make it really special!</h3>
      <p>I have an extremely  <em>wide-ranging repertoire of popular standards from the 1890's to the 1980s</em>. I have some popular classics arranged by myself for accordion, and also a repertoire of folk tunes, including representative medleys from Ireland, Wales, Greece and Russia. I also offer the following specialities, if you want a themed entertainment: <strong>French, English, Italian and Scottish</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Singalongs</h3>
      <p>For any of the four themed  specialities, by prior arrangement only, I can provide song sheets for the relevant theme, and lead a singalong.</p>

      <h3>Dancing</h3>
      <p>I can play live for ballroom dancing and a limited amount of rock, pop, and disco styles.  If a session of modern disco dancing is required, by prior arrangement only I can replay CDs or cassettes with excellent reproduction and volume.</p>
      <p>I can play solo for Barn Dancing and Scottish Dancing, if people know the dances.  That is feasible and economic if you are wanting just a short session of dancing. However, for a full evening, it may be more appropriate to book a ceilidh band (see Bodgers Mate below).</p>

      <h3>No Mains Needed</h3>
      <p>I have developed a battery-powered PA system built into my accordion case, which is loud enough for most venues and allows me to perform anywhere with no need for trailing wires.</p>
      <p>This offers great flexibility and safety in crowded restaurants, for example. I can quickly move to a different location, as required, but do not &lsquo;stroll&rsquo;. In many situations, the audience is mobile, therefore they can gravitate towards me (or away!) as they please. Strolling with a heavy accordion is tiring, and the sound is not so good.</p>

      <h3>Outdoor events</h3>
      <p>I can play out of doors for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Weddings, e.g. drinks on the lawn while photos are being taken, then moving indoors to play during the meal</li>
        <li>Garden parties, f&ecirc;tes</li>
        <li>Farmers' markets, continental markets</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I am popular with stall holders, an involuntary captive audience, because my extensive, timeless repertoire means I am not repeating a few tunes in one style. I can play under an umbrella if necessary, unless it is also windy. I aim to deliver a cheerful ambiance, whatever the weather!</p>

      <h3>Other recommended musicians</h3>
      <p>An excellent wedding ceilidh band, with the right mix of called dances, folk-rock songs, and a disco to follow, <a href="http://www.bodgersmate.co.uk/" title="Bodgers Mate" rel="external">Bodgers Mate</a>.</p>
