      <p>I have written guides to a few "one-man-band" accompaniment machines, also known as Realtime Arrangers, and I can post them anywhere in the world. Please e-mail me hugh@hughbarwell.co.uk to enquire, stating the country you want the guide sent to.</p>

      <h3>Roland RA-90 £5 inc p&p to UK. Please enquire for the price & postage to other countries.</h3>
      <p>This guide shows the MIDI accordionist how best to set up this module, and explains all 65 adjustable items in the "menu".</p>
      <p>There are suggestions on what style and tempo are suited to some well-known tunes. There is information on how to wire up footswitches. A new appendix explains how to investigate and test the transmitted channels of an unknown accordion, using the RA-90 as a diagnostic tool.</p>
      <p>My guide covers every aspect in a logical order, and is a completely different document from the official user manual.</p>

      <h3>Roland RA-800  User Guide for the Roland RA-800  £15 includes floppy disk and postage in the UK.   Please enquire for the price & postage to other countries.</h3>

      <p>This is a very sophisticated accompaniment module, but, using its disk drive, you can listen to 39 demo "songs" (sequences) that I have recorded, then easily load up the 39 performance memories that I used. Because the tunes are generic, you will find many other tunes can be played with the same settings.</p>
      <p>My guide covers nearly* every aspect in a logical order, and is a completely different document from the official user manual.  *I have not attempted to explain how to create User Styles, though I have included a couple of mine on the disk.</p>
      <p>Scottish players who find that the manufacturers have not catered for Reel and Jig styles can use this module to good effect with the accompaniment styles I have developed.</p>
      <p>I could also be persuaded to sell one or two of my RA-800 machines.</p>

      <h3>Orla XM 600,   with notes on the similar XM 800   £15 includes floppy disk and postage in the UK.     Please enquire for the price & postage to other countries.</h3>
      <p>The original owners'manual is sketchy and does not explain things very well. My guide helps MIDI accordionists find all the possible sounds, learn how to save and organise Performance memories. There is copious discussion of the different ways of using the module.</p>
      <p>The disk contains 23 demos & 4 bonus tracks  (42 minutes of listening). You can then easily load up the 23 performance memories that I used. Because the tunes are generic, you will find many other tunes can be played with the same settings.</p>
