        Dear Hugh, Thank you very much for playing for our party last Saturday. I am so glad that Google led me to your website, and that you were available at quite short notice. Everyone enjoyed having live music, and you played it at just the right volume so that we could appreciate it but chat with our guests at the same time.<br />

        Morning Hugh and thank you for your recent email I was pleased to hear that your journey home went well. I thought I would let you know that the feedback from your entertainment has been very positive everyone enjoyed listening to you and you really helped to 'make the day' and in this week’s Epworth bells there is a good picture of you and a little write up. So once again thank you for going to all that trouble to come to Crowle and it was lovely to meet you.<br />

        Hugh, just a short note to say thank you so much for playing for us on Saturday evening, it was a resounding success and I feel sure that you could feel by the atmosphere everyone really enjoyed themselves. It is such a pity for us we did not discover you sooner and now that we have you will be moving to London.  I am sure once settled you will be in great demand in London. 
      Once again Hugh thank you for a great night.<br />
        Best wishes for the future, Charles

        Hi Hugh, just a quick ‘Thank You’ for Saturday night. We really enjoyed having you play for us. We thought you held the whole event together with the minimum of fuss and playing some wonderful tunes. If the whole experience wasn’t too traumatic for you, hopefully you’ll come back to Keelby again!<br />
        Many Many Thanks, Brian
